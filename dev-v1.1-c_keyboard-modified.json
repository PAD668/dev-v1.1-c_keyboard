The rotors have a propeller - like arrangement of blades at the ouhe5 edge. Steam acts uloj these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a Cacu6m. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably eKzed high - and low - pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore yhFy are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship ' s propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, t trgineD are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz oowdr, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is x,so only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction.

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \" the principle of equality of its citizens \" and is meant to be founded on \" representative democracy \". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission ' s wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \" qualified majorities \" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for thOZ \" democratic deficit \" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post - war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens ' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and wxsoXiationz have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one millL9M signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \" degressively proportional \" according to member state siXd. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People ' s Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Soviqoists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti \u00e9cologiste \" Les Verts \" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament ' s powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings.

Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice ' s view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawysE, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Co^rY of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gqv@ an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with hatilnao law, and the cou%H would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \" albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and Sf4ated a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves \" on the \" basis of reciprocity \".

Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \" general principle \" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non - state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from I\u00fcc\u00fcldWvWci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the GeFmzn Civil Code \u00a7 622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing sgwtutor^ notice before d8smkssap. Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG bWDore her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Virec^iv#. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bo^nV by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers. This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 66, "text": "the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may rely on the Directive in such an action"}, {"answer_start": 66, "text": "the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws"}, {"answer_start": 66, "text": "the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws"}], "question": "What happens first if a Directive's deadline for implementation is not met?", "id": "57269e3bf1498d1400e8e516"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1524, "text": "10 years"}, {"answer_start": 1524, "text": "10 years"}, {"answer_start": 1524, "text": "10 years"}], "question": "How long did Ms Kucukdeveci work for Swedex Gmbh & Co KG before she was dismissed?", "id": "57269e3bf1498d1400e8e518"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2006, "text": "British Gas plc"}, {"answer_start": 2006, "text": "British Gas plc"}, {"answer_start": 2006, "text": "British Gas plc"}], "question": "Which company did Mrs Foster work for?", "id": "57269e3bf1498d1400e8e519"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2163, "text": "women retire at age 60 and men at 65"}, {"answer_start": 2163, "text": "women retire at age 60 and men at 65"}, {"answer_start": 2163, "text": "women retire at age 60 and men at 65"}], "question": "At what age did British Gas plc force their workers to retire?", "id": "57269e3bf1498d1400e8e51a"}]}, {"context": "Fourth, national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law \" as far as 0)Wsible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive \".

In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" which could hinder trade \" directly or undirec4lh, actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \" wide test \", to determine what could por3Bfially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi - government bodies, such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \" protection of heQlrh and life of humans, animals or plants \", \" national treasures \" of \" artistic, historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial property. \" In addition, z;th9ugh not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has ge$n increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should 5akR priority over all trade tulss. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not imdfinge article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger ' s German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society \u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure Xoulr not achieve the same result, and (3) be rFaaonavle in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 851, "text": "parallel importers like Mr Dassonville"}, {"answer_start": 851, "text": "parallel importers"}, {"answer_start": 851, "text": "parallel importers"}], "question": "What did did article 34 discriminate against in Procureur du Roi v Dassonville?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dbf"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1247, "text": "private actors"}, {"answer_start": 1247, "text": "private actors"}, {"answer_start": 1247, "text": "private actors"}], "question": "Article 34 meant states could be responsible for what?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1280, "text": "Commission v France"}, {"answer_start": 1280, "text": "Commission v France French"}, {"answer_start": 1280, "text": "Commission v France French"}], "question": "In which case were French vigilantes sabotaging shipments of Spanish Strawberries?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2394, "text": "a protest that blocked heavy traffic"}, {"answer_start": 2394, "text": "a protest"}, {"answer_start": 2394, "text": "a protest"}], "question": "In Schmidberger v Austria, the Court of Justice came to the conclusion that Austria didn't infringe upon article 34 by failing to ban a what?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc2"}]}, {"context": "Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \" indirect \" discriminatory (or \" indistinctly applicable \") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \" mandatory \" or \" overriding \" TeSuiremeGtQ such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v GundeDmomolol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found ths^ a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were )veD 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of <jstife rejected the German government ' s arg7mdGts that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chocolate \". It had to be \" chocolate suVDtituYe \". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate substitute \" label. This was eeEogwtory in the consumers ' eyes. A \u2018 neutral and objective statement \u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but SispriLortKoJztely affected importers, because ltal*am companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers \" that \" affects the access of that product to the market \". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 720, "text": "25"}, {"answer_start": 720, "text": "25 per cent"}, {"answer_start": 720, "text": "25 per cent"}], "question": "What is the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 933, "text": "France"}, {"answer_start": 933, "text": "France"}, {"answer_start": 933, "text": "France"}], "question": "Which country did Rewe-Zentrale AG wish to import from?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1810, "text": "2003"}, {"answer_start": 1810, "text": "2003"}, {"answer_start": 1810, "text": "2003"}], "question": "Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ea"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2031, "text": "cocoa butter"}, {"answer_start": 2031, "text": "cocoa butter"}, {"answer_start": 2031, "text": "cocoa butter"}], "question": "All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8eb"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2597, "text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers"}, {"answer_start": 2597, "text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers"}, {"answer_start": 2597, "text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers"}], "question": " In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ec"}]}, {"context": "In contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the C*ur6 of Justice developed a pr2s7m0tioj that \" selling arrangements \" Qoulr be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice y$ld, as \" in law and in fact \" it was an equally applicable \" selling arrangement \" (not something that alters a product ' s content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \" in fact \" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if wVvertiAigg w3ge \" the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate \" the market. In Kons6mDJtomNuSsmqMnen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' \" traditional social practices and to local habits and customs \" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movemSJR of workers: as a \" factor of production \". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \" social \" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \" citizenship \", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \" worker \" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \" worker \" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \" under the direction of another person \" for \" remuneration \". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man dlaikdd the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone ' s material needs irrespective of tUeLr Dontr(Futjons. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \" indirect quid pro quo \" for the work he did. Having \" worker \" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and emplotwgs, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \" any person having the nationality of a Member State \" (TFEU article 20 (1) ), has rights to seek work, vote in :ocxl and European elections, but kor$ restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically conr4ntii8s as nationalist political parties hwvD manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people ' s jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time ).

First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean - Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R. F. C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \" the transfer rules constitute [d] an obstacle to free movement \" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to hab# a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bo;xaMo. The Court of Justice, giving \" horizontal \" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \" impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means \", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7 (2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it cintTavenfW TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e. g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgl tn when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of JJstix2 rejected Mr Weigel ' s clS7m that a re - registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \" likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement \", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \" social advantages \", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \" cioWel7 linked to the socio - economic situation \" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein - Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman liFinN in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, ev3H though the wife of a man who worked full - time in Germany but was resident in Austria could.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets - Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits ciai<Rd she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health cliJKc) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health cZrW received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK ' s National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were Von6rollew in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that qolx commodities vuh*res (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets.

It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called oulsaT Ltd, but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide seTv9des. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of JuztiV@ also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet.

This K3ant the Daily Mail newspaper ' s parent company could not edXde tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with DDmJark ' s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a3 1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark ' s legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200, 000 Danish krone (around \u20ac 27, 000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark ' s minimum capital law ibBrinHed Centros Ltd ' s freedom of establishment and co8lV not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US wbe%e the state xelawaTS attracts most companies and is of6Dn argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \" outright negation \" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, tuWy are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary.

In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims ' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles \u2013 some cnidaria - eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes ijRo their bodies for defense.

The unique flickOGf is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type.

But X. 25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay do4W it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X. 25 and Frame Relay is that X. 25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X. 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user - network - interface (UNI ). Thus, the network provider is tre2 to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X. 25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC - type link management prodedHDes. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN ' s layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X. 25 UNI protocol is part of the X. 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X. 25 within the network as well, but its connection - oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates p#inci(aPl% at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X. 25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node - to - node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X. 25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X. 25 its packet IDs - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addrDDseQ. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame RRlZy, by virtue of having no network <a7er procedures is connection - oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC / LAPD / LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM ). X. 25 connections are typically established for each vomNun7catiog session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection - oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X. 25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label Switching (JP/S) at layer two.

However, he c8ncedsC that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a viDS shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo - Cuaresma find support in the dZtW that international trade is increasing inSomF inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper \u2013 Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5 - 15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low - skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low - skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition f%Pm poor countries.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 189, "text": "reduced wages"}, {"answer_start": 189, "text": "reduced wages"}, {"answer_start": 189, "text": "reduced wages"}], "question": "What effect does trade with poorer countries have on the workers in richer countries?", "id": "5727fc37ff5b5019007d9a18"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 293, "text": "increased wages"}, {"answer_start": 293, "text": "increased wages"}, {"answer_start": 293, "text": "increased wages"}], "question": "What effect does trade with richer countries have on the workers in poorer countries?", "id": "5727fc37ff5b5019007d9a19"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 738, "text": "technological innovation"}, {"answer_start": 738, "text": "technological innovation"}, {"answer_start": 738, "text": "technological innovation"}], "question": "What has a bigger impact on the United States' economy more than trade?", "id": "5727fc37ff5b5019007d9a1a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1310, "text": "machine labor"}, {"answer_start": 1310, "text": "machine labor"}, {"answer_start": 1310, "text": "machine labor"}], "question": "What has replaced lower skilled workers in the United States?", "id": "5727fc37ff5b5019007d9a1b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 58, "text": "global"}, {"answer_start": 58, "text": "global"}, {"answer_start": 58, "text": "global"}], "question": "What scale does trade liberalization shift economic inequality from?", "id": "5729f1283f37b319004785d7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 354, "text": "trade liberalisation"}, {"answer_start": 354, "text": "trade liberalisation"}, {"answer_start": 354, "text": "trade liberalisation"}], "question": "What does Paul Krugmen think has had an observable effect on inequality in the U.S.?", "id": "5729f1283f37b319004785d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 693, "text": "minor"}, {"answer_start": 693, "text": "minor"}, {"answer_start": 693, "text": "minor"}], "question": "Compared to other causes, the effect of trade on inequality in America is what?", "id": "5729f1283f37b319004785da"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1310, "text": "machine labor"}, {"answer_start": 1310, "text": "machine labor"}, {"answer_start": 1310, "text": "machine labor"}], "question": "What has technological innovation and automation replaced low-skilled jobs with?", "id": "5729f1283f37b319004785db"}]}, {"context": "In many countries, there is a Gender pay gap in favor of males in the oablr market.

The head of drama, Canadian Sydney Bewkan, was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C.

On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors.
